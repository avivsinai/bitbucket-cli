# Security operations playbook

This document expands on the top-level [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) with
implementation details.

## Secrets handling

- bkt never stores plaintext credentials under version control. Tokens are read
  from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bkt/config.yml` with permissions `0600`.
- For development, set `BKT_CONFIG_DIR` to a throwaway directory.
- Never commit test credentials. Use environment variables or the
  `internal/config/testdata` fixtures when unit testing.

## Dependency updates

- Dependabot is enabled for Go modules and GitHub Actions (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- Run `go list -m -u all` periodically to spot stale modules.
- CI runs [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) weekly.

## Supply chain

- Release artifacts are built with GoReleaser (`goreleaser.yaml`).
- Each release publishes a checksum manifest and an SBOM generated via Syft.
- Container images (if built) are signed with cosign and accompanied by an SBOM.

## Incident response

1. Triage the report and reproduce the issue.
2. Assign a severity (CVSS) and determine the affected versions.
3. Prepare a patch on a private branch. Request a security review from another
   maintainer.
4. Tag a release with the fix and update `CHANGELOG.md` with mitigation steps.
5. Notify the reporter and disclose publicly within seven days of the fix.
